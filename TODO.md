## Superpowers Skills to Use

The following skills from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) will be integrated into our workflow:

- [ ] **writing-plans** - Break work into bite-sized tasks with exact file paths, complete code, and verification steps
- [ ] **using-git-worktrees** - Create isolated workspaces on new branches; run project setup and verify clean test baseline
- [ ] **subagent-driven-development** - Dispatch fresh subagents per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality)
- [ ] **test-driven-development** - Enforce RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle; write failing test first, then minimal passing code, then commit
